Spark Streaming
Spark Streaming共有三种运用场景
1 无状态操作   当前新生成的小批次数据，所有计算都只是基于这个批次的数据进行处理 
如 一个批次在一天时间内生成的数据，算一天的贷款额度，或者1min的贷款额度。

2 状态操作    关注多个RDD从头到尾累加起来，每个RDD中的某个值进行累加 。总的贷款额度

3  window操作
一个窗口DStream（windowed DStream），窗口操作需要设置两个参数：
（1）窗口长度（window length），即窗口的持续时间，上图中的窗口长度为3
（2）滑动间隔（sliding interval），窗口操作执行的时间间隔，上图中的滑动间隔为2


Spark Streaming 主要用于快速构建可扩展，高吞吐量，高容错的流处理程序。支持从 HDFS，Flume，Kafka，Twitter 和 ZeroMQ 读取数据，并进行处理。

如果从kafka读数据的话可以用 kafka stream 。 spring cloud stream 来实现。

Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides
high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a
rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames,
MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing,
and Structured Streaming for stream processing.

## Online Documentation

You can find the latest Spark documentation, including a programming
guide, on the [project web page](https://spark.apache.org/documentation.html).
This README file only contains basic setup instructions.

## Building Spark

Spark is built using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
To build Spark and its example programs, run:

    build/mvn -DskipTests clean package

(You do not need to do this if you downloaded a pre-built package.)

You can build Spark using more than one thread by using the -T option with Maven, see ["Parallel builds in Maven 3"](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Parallel+builds+in+Maven+3).
More detailed documentation is available from the project site, at
["Building Spark"](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html).

For general development tips, including info on developing Spark using an IDE, see ["Useful Developer Tools"](https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html).

## Interactive Scala Shell

The easiest way to start using Spark is through the Scala shell:

    ./bin/spark-shell

Try the following command, which should return 1,000,000,000:

    scala> spark.range(1000 * 1000 * 1000).count()

## Interactive Python Shell

Alternatively, if you prefer Python, you can use the Python shell:

    ./bin/pyspark

And run the following command, which should also return 1,000,000,000:

    >>> spark.range(1000 * 1000 * 1000).count()

## Example Programs

Spark also comes with several sample programs in the `examples` directory.
To run one of them, use `./bin/run-example <class> [params]`. For example:

    ./bin/run-example SparkPi

will run the Pi example locally.

You can set the MASTER environment variable when running examples to submit
examples to a cluster. This can be a mesos:// or spark:// URL,
"yarn" to run on YARN, and "local" to run
locally with one thread, or "local[N]" to run locally with N threads. You
can also use an abbreviated class name if the class is in the `examples`
package. For instance:

    MASTER=spark://host:7077 ./bin/run-example SparkPi

Many of the example programs print usage help if no params are given.

## Running Tests

Testing first requires [building Spark](#building-spark). Once Spark is built, tests
can be run using:

    ./dev/run-tests

Please see the guidance on how to
[run tests for a module, or individual tests](https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#individual-tests).

There is also a Kubernetes integration test, see resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests/README.md

## A Note About Hadoop Versions

Spark uses the Hadoop core library to talk to HDFS and other Hadoop-supported
storage systems. Because the protocols have changed in different versions of
Hadoop, you must build Spark against the same version that your cluster runs.

Please refer to the build documentation at
["Specifying the Hadoop Version and Enabling YARN"](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/building-spark.html#specifying-the-hadoop-version-and-enabling-yarn)
for detailed guidance on building for a particular distribution of Hadoop, including
building for particular Hive and Hive Thriftserver distributions.

## Configuration

Please refer to the [Configuration Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html)
in the online documentation for an overview on how to configure Spark.

## Contributing

Please review the [Contribution to Spark guide](https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html)
for information on how to get started contributing to the project.
